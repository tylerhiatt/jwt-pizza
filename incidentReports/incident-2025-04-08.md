# Incident: Chaos Testing 2025-04-08 9:21:00

## Summary

```md
Between the hour of 9:21 and 11:57 MST on April 8th, 2025, all users experienced failures when attempting to place pizza orders through the JWT Pizza application.. The event was triggered by a chaos testing injection at 9:21. During the chaos window, the /api/order endpoint began returning 500 Internal Server Errors with the message "Failed to fulfill order at factory."

This high-severity incident prevented successful order processing and resulted in revenue loss and user-facing failures for the duration of the issue. It was resolved once the recovery URL provided in the error log was visited to report and fix the failure in the pizza factory simulation service. This high-severity incident affected 100% of users during this window.
```

## Detection

```md
This incident was detected when the Pizza Purchase Failure alert was triggered and the JWT Pizza DevOps team was paged. This alert was ultimately triggered due to a spike in 500-level HTTP error logs in the Grafana Logs panel, specifically on the /api/order route. The metrics showed revenue dropping to 0 and pizza failure counts increasing, triggering the alerts in the "Pizzas Purchases" dashboard

The team improved detection time by including detailed error logs and enabling logging of the factory's report URL, which was instrumental in the resolution.
```

## Impact

```md
For 2 hours and 37 minutes between 09:21 and 11:57 MST on 04/08/25, users were unable to place pizza orders through the JWT Pizza application due to factory failures.

This incident affected all users attempting to place orders, leading to a 100% drop in revenue and a spike in pizza creation failure metrics. No external support tickets were submitted due to the internal nature of the test, but internal monitoring and alerts were triggered.
```

## Timeline

```md
All times are MST.

09:21 - Chaos test begins. Pizza orders begin failing.

09:22 - Alert fires for spike in pizza creation failures.

09:23 - Alert fires for drop in revenue.

09:25 - Investigation begins. Logs for /api/order show repeated 500 errors.

11:55 - Report URL was extracted from error log.

11:56 - Visiting reportUrl initiates factory recovery.

11:57 - Orders begin succeeding again.

11:58 - Metrics stabilize and revenue resumes.
```

## Response

```md
After receiving automated alerts at 09:22 MST, the on-call devOps engineer on the JWT Pizza DevOps team began investigating at 09:25 MST. After a few failed attempts at trying to fix the error, including changing the Logs to identify the message body, the engineer examined the fixed Logs panel and identified the consistent error message "Failed to fulfill order at factory." The log also included a URL, which was visited to trigger a recovery routine in the simulated factory service. This action was finally restored service by 11:57 MST.
```

## Root cause

```md
The root cause was an intentional chaos test injection that disabled the ability for the factory service to fulfill pizza orders. The test was designed to simulate factory-level service outages.
```

## Resolution

```md
The issue was resolved by using the report URL provided in the error response body. This manual recovery action triggered the factory to resume fulfilling orders.

No code changes were required. The resolution also validated that proper logging and metric instrumentation were in place. The alerting was in place to let the on-call engineer know that pizza failures were occuring and the revenue dropped.
```

## Prevention

```md
The system behaved as expected during chaos testing. However, the root cause revealed that only manual intervention via the report URL resolves the issue.

In future chaos events, clearer alert messages, better logs, and an automated report URL trigger system could improve resolution time.
```

## Action items

```md
1. Add automation to visit factory report URL for known chaos test errors (Owner: DevOps, Due: 04/15/25)

2. Enhance alert messaging to reference the report URL pattern when factory errors are detected (Owner: DevOps, Due: 04/15/25)

3. Document chaos resolution procedure in the internal runbook (Owner: DevOps, Due: 04/15/25)
