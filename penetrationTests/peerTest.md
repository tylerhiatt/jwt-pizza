Attack 2  
| Item | Result |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Date | April 12, 2025 |
| Target | pizza.cambridgeuniverse.org |
| Classification | Identification & Authentication Failures |
| Severity | 4 |
| Description | Able to brute force administration password, allowing log in as admin. This allowed unrestricted access to stores and franchises, as well as the authtoken for the Attack 3 |
| Images | ![Logged in as Admin](loggedInAdmin.png) <br/> Database data remained unaffected |
| Corrections | Require advanced passwords that aren't known to be common passwords |

Attack 3  
| Item | Result |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Date | April 12, 2025 |
| Target | pizza.cambridgeuniverse.org |
| Classification | Security Misconfiguration |
| Severity | 4 |
| Description | API endpoint exposed the admin users that allows user to update an arbitrary user's email and password. Using the authtoken from Attack 3, control was obtained over mutliple user accounts |
| Images | ![Edited Credentials](newCredentials.png) <br/> Database data remained unaffected |
| Corrections | Remove the endpoint that allows admins to change any user's information. This is a completely unnecessary endpoint in its current configuration. |

## Summary

During the exercise, we found that the pizza code base was secured against our elementary SQL injection attacks. However, the presence of common admin accounts exposed the sites to significant damage.
Logging in as an admin allowed for the franchises and stores to be deleted, rendering the company's product completely unavailable. Additionally, having an administrator's authtoken allowed for calling
an API endpoint that updates any user's email and password. This allowed bad actors to lock out any number of users based on their numerically ascending ID, as well as gain access to their accounts with
the updated credentials. We also discovered that a CORS misconfiguration initally allowed unauthorized origins to make cross-origin requests with credentials. This posed a threat that could have enabled a malicious third-party sity to impersonate a logged-in user and steal sensitive information.
